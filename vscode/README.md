## Features

- **One-Click Logging**: Highlight any variable and instantly insert a formatted log statement
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and more
- **Smart Formatting**: Automatically formats log statements according to language conventions
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Use `Ctrl+Alt+L` (or `Cmd+Alt+L` on Mac) for lightning-fast logging
- **Context Menu Integration**: Right-click and select "Insert QuikLog" from the context menu

### How It Works

1. Highlight a variable in your code
2. Press `Ctrl+Alt+L` (or right-click and select "Insert QuikLog")
3. Done! A formatted log appears on the next line

## Supported languages (templates)

The table below shows the log template QuikLog inserts for a given language. Replace `variable` with your selected identifier or expression.

| Language | Inserted template | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `console.log('variable: ', variable);` | Uses single quotes and a trailing comma for readable output |
| Python | `print('variable: ', variable)` | Python print without semicolon |
| Java | `System.out.println("variable: " + variable);` | Uses string concatenation for Java |
| Feature (Karate) | `* print 'variable: ', variable` | Karate feature file print statement |

If your language isn't listed, open an issue ‚Äî templates are easy to add.
